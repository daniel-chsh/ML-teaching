# ML-teaching
**What's going on here:**
On the ML Community at the company where I work, I host lectures/workshops about Machine Learning.
The lectures don't come out as often as I'd like, but as they do, I'll be posting notebooks from the lectures so that everyone can dive into the world of Data Science. These lectures are geared more toward beginners and will be useful to those who are just diving into the world of data science. There are no complicated constructions in the code as much as possible. This is done for better understanding.

 > For me, the purpose of these lectures at the company is to raise the level of beginners. I want to give them the tools to go deeper into data, get insights and draw conclusions useful for business

| [**Neural Networks Intro**](./neural_networks/FMNIST.ipynb) | An introductory lecture on neural networks. It is aimed at beginners and allows you to run your first neural network for an image classification task without any in-depth knowledge and compare the results with classical machine learning algorithms. The comparison was performed on the Fasion-MNIST dataset | [**Neural Networks: Basics**](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-basics-29cc093b82be), [**Understanding Neural Networks**](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understanding-neural-networks-from-neuron-to-rnn-cnn-and-deep-learning-cd88e90e0a90)
